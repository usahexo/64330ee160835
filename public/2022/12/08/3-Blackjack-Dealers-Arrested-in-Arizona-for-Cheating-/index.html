<p>The dealers, all women, were caught on camera changing the results of hands to favor themselves. They would manipulate the cards in various ways in order to increase their chances of winning.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that dealers have been caught cheating at blackjack. In fact, it is a fairly common occurrence. But what makes this case different is that the dealers were caught on camera.</p>
<p>Casinos are always on the lookout for signs of dealer cheating, and they have sophisticated security systems in place to detect it. So when three dealers were caught on camera cheating, casino officials knew they had to take action.</p>
<p>The three dealers have been fired from their jobs and are facing criminal charges. They could be sentenced to prison if convicted.</p>
<p>This case serves as a reminder that casinos are not always fair places to play. If you want to make sure you don’t get cheated, stick to games that are played against the house, such as roulette and craps.</p>

<p>The incident took place at the Gila River Casino in Chandler, AZ. According to police, the dealer was trying to break up a physical altercation between two players when she was punched by one of them, and then subsequently hit in the head again by the other player.</p>
<p>She was transported to a local hospital for treatment of her injuries and has since been released.</p>
<p>Casino security personnel eventually intervened and were able to detain both players until authorities arrived.</p>
<p>Both men have been charged with aggravated assault.</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Dealer-Caught-Cheating-in-Arizona"><a href="#Blackjack-Dealer-Caught-Cheating-in-Arizona" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Dealer Caught Cheating in Arizona"></a>Blackjack Dealer Caught Cheating in Arizona</h1><p>In a stunning turn of events, a blackjack dealer at the Talking Stick Resort and Casino in Scottsdale, Arizona was caught cheating over the weekend. </p>
<p>The dealer, who has not been identified, was caught on security footage dealing cards from the bottom of the deck. This allowed him to stack the deck in his favor, giving him a better chance of winning against players at the table. </p>
<p>The cheating came to light when one of the players at the table noticed that the dealer was dealing from the bottom of the deck and alerted security. </p>
<p> casino officials have released a statement saying that they take cheating seriously and that anyone caught doing so will be immediately terminated and banned from all properties owned by the casino company. </p>
<p>This is not the first time that a dealer has been caught cheating at a casino. In 2012, a dealer at Harrah’s Casino in Las Vegas was caught dealing from the bottom of the deck. </p>
<h1 id="Arizona-Casino-Dealer-Hits-on-21-Twice-in-a-Row"><a href="#Arizona-Casino-Dealer-Hits-on-21-Twice-in-a-Row" class="headerlink" title="Arizona Casino Dealer Hits on 21 Twice in a Row"></a>Arizona Casino Dealer Hits on 21 Twice in a Row</h1><p>Casinos always have their dealers trained to hit on 21 as opposed to stand. This helps to ensure that the house keeps its edge over the players. However, in a recent game at an Arizona casino, one dealer hit on 21 not once, but twice in a row.</p>
<p>The incident occurred at the Gila River Casino in Chandler, AZ. On July 12th, Natalie Webb was dealt two blackjacks in a row while playing at one of the casino’s blackjack tables. While this might seem like a lucky break for Webb, it actually resulted in her losing $1,600.</p>
<p>According to the dealer, she made the decision to hit on both hands based on the cards she was initially dealt. Even though Webb didn’t end up winning the hand, she was still impressed by the dealer’s skill. “That was pretty impressive. I don’t know many people who could do that twice in a row,” said Webb.</p>
<p>While unlikely, it is possible for dealers to hit on 21 twice in a row. In fact, it has happened before and is likely to happen again in the future. So if you find yourself at an Arizona casino and are dealt two blackjacks in a row, be prepared to lose your money!</p>
<h1 id="Blackjack-Dealer-Busted-for-Cheating-at-Arizona-Casino"><a href="#Blackjack-Dealer-Busted-for-Cheating-at-Arizona-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack Dealer Busted for Cheating at Arizona Casino"></a>Blackjack Dealer Busted for Cheating at Arizona Casino</h1><p>The Arizona Department of Gaming has announced that a blackjack dealer has been arrested on suspicion of cheating at a casino in the state.</p>
<p>According to officials, the dealer was caught altering the outcome of several blackjack hands by adding cards to players’ hands in order to improve their chances of winning.</p>
<p>Investigators say that they became suspicious after noticing several unusually high wins by players at the table where the dealer was working.</p>
<p>After reviewing security footage from the casino, officials determined that the dealer had been adding cards to players’ hands in order to help them win.</p>
<p>The dealer has been booked into custody and is awaiting trial. If convicted, he could face up to five years in prison.</p>
