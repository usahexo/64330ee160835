The heist is initiated by Lester Crest and requires the player to acquire various vehicles and equipment for the robbery.</p>
<p>The player must first acquire a Bravado Gauntlet armored car. They must then steal a L taxpayer utility van from a Los Santos department store, and use it to transport the team and equipment to the casino. Once at the casino, the player must drill through the wall to gain access to the vault, and then empty out the safe deposit boxes.</p>
<p>The final stage of the heist involves escaping with the loot, which can be done in several ways. The player can escape by helicopter, jetpack or motorcycle; or they can use stealth to avoid detection and escape through the back door.</p>

PGSoft has recently revealed some details about what you need to do in order to complete the heist.</p>
<p>In order to complete the Diamond Casino Heist, you will need:</p>
<p>-A minimum of 4 players</p>
<p>-A helicopter</p>
<p>-At least $5 million in cash</p>
<p>-The ability to fly a helicopter</p>
<p>-The ability to hack security systems</p>
<p>If you do not have all of these items, you will not be able to complete the heist. PGSoft recommends that you try and gather as many of these items as possible before attempting the heist, as it will be much harder to complete if you do not have them all.</p>

This guide will teach you everything you need to know before undertaking this heist.</p>
<p>Planning is key when robbing any casino, and the Diamond Casino is no exception. Locate the security room and disable the cameras and guards inside. There are several ways to do this; one way is to use a gas canister to render them unconscious.</p>
<p>Once the security room is clear, make your way to the vault. The quickest way is through the basement, but be careful as there are cameras and guards down there as well. The vault itself is protected by a security door; however, there is a button located on the wall behind the vault that will open it up.</p>
<p>Once inside, take whatever money and diamonds you want and make your escape! Be sure to disable the security systems on your way out so that you aren’t caught.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-beat-the-Diamond-Casino-Heist-What-do-you-need"><a href="#How-to-beat-the-Diamond-Casino-Heist-What-do-you-need" class="headerlink" title="How to beat the Diamond Casino Heist: What do you need!"></a>How to beat the Diamond Casino Heist: What do you need!</h1><p>With the Diamond Casino Heist now available on GTA Online, Rockstar Games has released a list of the necessary items needed to pull off this high-stakes robbery.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Master Planning<br>Before you can rob the Diamond Casino, you need to do some planning. You’ll need to scout out the casino, figure out how to get inside and what kind of security measures are in place. This step is absolutely essential if you want to avoid getting caught.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Robbery Gear<br>Once you have your plan in place, it’s time to gather your robbery gear. This includes things like masks, ropes, tools and guns. Make sure you have everything you need before attempting the heist.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Crew<br>You won’t be able to pull off the heist by yourself – you’ll need a team of thieves! Choose your crew carefully and make sure everyone knows their role in the plan.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Escape Route<br>It’s important to have an escape route planned out in case things go wrong. You don’t want to get stuck inside the casino with the police coming after you! Make sure your team knows how to get out quickly and safely.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Disguises<br>If you want to avoid detection, it’s important to wear disguises while robbing the casino. This will help keep you hidden from security cameras and other eyes and ears that may be watching or listening for any clues about the robbery.</p>
</li>
</ol>
