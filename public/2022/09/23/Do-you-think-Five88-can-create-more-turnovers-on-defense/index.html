        <h1 id="Do-you-think-Five88-can-create-more-turnovers-on-defense"><a href="#Do-you-think-Five88-can-create-more-turnovers-on-defense" class="headerlink" title="Do you think Five88 can create more turnovers on defense?"></a>Do you think Five88 can create more turnovers on defense?</h1><p>No. Five88 is not a good defensive team and they are not going to create more turnovers. In fact, they are going to give up more turnovers this season.</p>
<h1 id="Can-the-Indianapolis-Colts-maintain-their-winning-streak-against-the-Houston-Texans"><a href="#Can-the-Indianapolis-Colts-maintain-their-winning-streak-against-the-Houston-Texans" class="headerlink" title="Can the Indianapolis Colts maintain their winning streak against the Houston Texans?"></a>Can the Indianapolis Colts maintain their winning streak against the Houston Texans?</h1><p>The Indianapolis Colts (3-5) will have their work cut out for them when they take on the Houston Texans (3-5) this week. The Colts have been on a roll, winning their past three games, while the Texans have lost their past three.</p>
<p>Houston was able to beat the Colts in both meetings last season, but the Colts are a different team this year. They have been playing much better offensively, averaging over 26 points per game in their past three contests.</p>
<p>Quarterback Andrew Luck has been playing extremely well, and is coming off of his best performance of the season last week against the Miami Dolphins. He completed 27 of 43 passes for 353 yards and four touchdowns.</p>
<p>The Colts will need to continue to rely on Luck’s passing ability this week against Houston. The Texans have one of the best defenses in the NFL, so the Colts will need to score a lot of points to win.</p>
<p>Running back Frank Gore has also been playing well recently, rushing for over 100 yards in each of the team’s past two games. He will be important in helping to keep the Texans defense honest and not just focus on stopping Luck’s passing attack.</p>
<p>Houston has also been playing better offensively lately, averaging over 24 points per game in their past three contests. Quarterback Brock Osweiler has been somewhat inconsistent this season, but has shown some signs of improvement in recent weeks.</p>
<p> Osweiler will need to play better than he has earlier in the season if Houston wants to upset the Colts this week. The Texans’ biggest strength lies in their running game. Running back Lamar Miller has rushed for over 700 yardsthis season and is averaging 4.8 yards per carry.</p>
<p>If Houston can get Miller going early, it could open up opportunities for Osweiler downfield later in the game. If both teams play at their best, this should be an exciting matchup that comes down to the wire.</p>
<h1 id="What-adjustments-will-the-Golden-State-Warriors-make-to-combat-the-Oklahoma-City-Thunder"><a href="#What-adjustments-will-the-Golden-State-Warriors-make-to-combat-the-Oklahoma-City-Thunder" class="headerlink" title="What adjustments will the Golden State Warriors make to combat the Oklahoma City Thunder?"></a>What adjustments will the Golden State Warriors make to combat the Oklahoma City Thunder?</h1><p>In their previous matchup, the Oklahoma City Thunder managed to defeat the Golden State Warriors thanks in part to Russell Westbrook’s triple-double. This time around, the Warriors will be looking to make some adjustments in order to gain an advantage.</p>
<p>One of the adjustments that the Warriors may consider is increasing Draymond Green’s minutes. In their game against the Thunder, Green only played 26 minutes, which was significantly less than his season average of 33 minutes per game. By increasing Green’s minutes, the Warriors can put more pressure on the Thunder defense and potentially force them into making mistakes.</p>
<p>The Warriors may also want to consider playing Kevon Looney more. In their last matchup against the Thunder, Looney only played two minutes. By playing Looney more, the Warriors can add another body to help protect the rim and take rebounds away from the Thunder.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Warriors may want to consider changing their defensive strategy. In their last matchup against OKC, they primarily focused on defending Westbrook and Paul George. However, this allowed Steven Adams to have a field day in the paint. By defending Adams more closely, they can make it more difficult for him to score points and get rebounds.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-think-LeBron-James-and-Kyrie-Irving-will-fare-against-the-San-Antonio-Spurs"><a href="#How-do-you-think-LeBron-James-and-Kyrie-Irving-will-fare-against-the-San-Antonio-Spurs" class="headerlink" title="How do you think LeBron James and Kyrie Irving will fare against the San Antonio Spurs?"></a>How do you think LeBron James and Kyrie Irving will fare against the San Antonio Spurs?</h1><p>LeBron James and Kyrie Irving are two of the best players in the NBA. However, they will have their work cut out for them against the San Antonio Spurs. The Spurs are a well-coached team that is always playoff ready. They have a balance of veterans and young players who all play unselfishly.</p>
<p>The Spurs are led by Kawhi Leonard and LaMarcus Aldridge. Leonard is a two-time Defensive Player of the Year, and Aldridge is a former All-Star. These two players can score both inside and outside. They are also very good defenders.</p>
<p>Tony Parker is another key player for the Spurs. He is a veteran point guard who knows how to run the offense. Pau Gasol is also a veteran player who can score in the post and rebound.</p>
<p>The Spurs also have some young players who are coming into their own. Dejounte Murray is a young point guard who has shown great promise this season. Kyle Anderson is a versatile player who can rebound and defend multiple positions. Jakob Poeltl is a rookie center who has been impressive in limited minutes this season.</p>
<p>The Spurs have one of the best coaches in the NBA in Gregg Popovich. He knows how to get the most out of his players and make sure they are prepared for playoff basketball.</p>
<p>James and Irving will need to be at their best if they want to defeat the Spurs in the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Will-Russell-Westbrook-break-the-Triple-Double-record-this-season"><a href="#Will-Russell-Westbrook-break-the-Triple-Double-record-this-season" class="headerlink" title="Will Russell Westbrook break the Triple-Double record this season?"></a>Will Russell Westbrook break the Triple-Double record this season?</h1><p>Russell Westbrook is having a historical season. He is on pace to break the Triple-Double record, but can he do it?</p>
<p>Westbrook has averaged a triple double for the season so far. He has had six triple doubles in his last 10 games. This puts him on pace to have 40 for the season. The current record is held by Oscar Robertson who had 41 in the 1961-1962 season.</p>
<p>There are some skeptics who think that Westbrook cannot keep up this pace for the whole season. They feel that he will eventually cool off and not be able to average a triple double for the entire season.</p>
<p>However, Westbrook has never been one to back down from a challenge. He has always been a player who wants to push himself to the limits. He is also very determined to win. This combination could lead him to break the Triple-Double record this season.</p>
<p>Westbrook has already proved that he can average a triple double for a game or even for a week. So it is definitely possible for him to do it for an entire season. He has also shown that he can score and rebound when needed. This makes him a very dangerous player on the court.</p>
<p>The rest of the NBA will definitely have their eyes on Westbrook as he tries to break the Triple-Double record this season. They will be trying everything they can to stop him from achieving this feat. But with Westbrook’s determination and drive, it is definitely possible for him to achieve this goal.</p>
