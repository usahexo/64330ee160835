        <h1 id="Efes-Beats-Laboral-Kutxa-In-Thriller-After-Under-Comes-Up-BIG"><a href="#Efes-Beats-Laboral-Kutxa-In-Thriller-After-Under-Comes-Up-BIG" class="headerlink" title="Efes Beats Laboral Kutxa In Thriller After Under Comes Up BIG!"></a>Efes Beats Laboral Kutxa In Thriller After Under Comes Up BIG!</h1><p>In a game that had everything, the Efes Pilsen beat FC Laboral Kutxa 94-92 Wednesday night in dramatic fashion. The game was back and forth the whole way, with neither team leading by more than six points. With Laboral Kutxa up 92-90 and only seconds remaining on the clock, Efes Pilsen’s Milan Macvan hit a three pointer to give his team the lead for good.</p>
<p>The game was not without controversy, as Laboral Kutxa appeared to have control of the ball with less than ten seconds remaining. However, after review it was ruled that the ball went out of bounds off of an Efes player, giving Macvan his chance to win the game.</p>
<p>For Macvan, it was a sweet victory after scoring only two points in the first half. “I think this is my best moment in basketball. I didn’t score in the first half but I kept fighting and when Coach called my number I just tried to do my best.” said Macvan after the game.</p>
<p>Both teams fought hard throughout, with Laboral Kutxa’s Jaka Lakovic (26 points) and Efes Pilsen’s Rudy Fernandez (25 points) leading their respective teams in scoring. Fernandez also had eight rebounds and four assists while Lakovic had six rebounds and six assists.</p>
<p>Efes Pilsen now advances to the Euroleague Final Four for the second consecutive year while FC Laboral Kutxa will have to content themselves with Champions League play next season.</p>
<h1 id="Efes-Falls-Just-Short-To-Valencia-But-The-Under-Still-Picks-Up-A-Win"><a href="#Efes-Falls-Just-Short-To-Valencia-But-The-Under-Still-Picks-Up-A-Win" class="headerlink" title="Efes Falls Just Short To Valencia, But The Under Still Picks Up A Win!"></a>Efes Falls Just Short To Valencia, But The Under Still Picks Up A Win!</h1><p>It was a back and forth match all game long between Efes and Valencia, but the Turkish side just couldn’t overcome the Spanish squad in the end. However, despite the loss on the scoreboard, the Istanbul team was still able to get the win on the board, as they covered the spread with a final score of 94-89.</p>
<p>Efes got off to a quick start in this one, thanks in part to some hot shooting from guard Derrick Williams. The former 2nd overall pick in the NBA draft knocked down a trio of triples in the first quarter alone, as he helped his team take an early lead. That advantage would dissipate as the game went on, but Williams remained a force throughout, finishing with 24 points on 8-of-13 shooting from behind the arc.</p>
<p>While Williams was busy lighting it up from outside, Valencia players like Alberto Abalde and Sam Van Rossom were doing most of the damage inside. The two combined for 44 points on 19-of-32 shooting, as they led their team to a narrow victory. Abalde was particularly impressive down the stretch, scoring 11 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter alone.</p>
<p>Despite falling just short in the end, Efes can hold their heads high after covering the spread against one of Europe’s top teams. This young squad is definitely one to watch in future competitions!</p>
<h1 id="Efes-Defeats-FC-Barcelona-Behind-Huge-Night-From-Under"><a href="#Efes-Defeats-FC-Barcelona-Behind-Huge-Night-From-Under" class="headerlink" title="Efes Defeats FC Barcelona Behind Huge Night From Under!"></a>Efes Defeats FC Barcelona Behind Huge Night From Under!</h1><p>In what was perhaps the biggest upset of the week in European basketball, Efes Istanbul defeated FC Barcelona 86-68 behind a huge night from its bench. Efes’s reserves outscored Barcelona’s reserves 49-9, led by Dogus Balbay and James Anderson who each scored 16 points.</p>
<p>Efes played great defense throughout the game, holding Barcelona to just 38% shooting from the field. This is the second time this season that Efes has beaten Barcelona, with the first victory coming in December in Barcelona.</p>
<p>The loss is a big blow for Barcelona, which is now 14-5 on the season and just one game ahead of Real Madrid for first place in the Liga ACB. FC Barcelona will have a chance to bounce back on Thursday when it hosts Unicaja Malaga.</p>
<h1 id="Gran-Canaria-Knocks-Off-Efes-In-Overtime-Under-Disappoints-Again"><a href="#Gran-Canaria-Knocks-Off-Efes-In-Overtime-Under-Disappoints-Again" class="headerlink" title="Gran Canaria Knocks Off Efes In Overtime; Under Disappoints Again"></a>Gran Canaria Knocks Off Efes In Overtime; Under Disappoints Again</h1><p>The Gran Canaria Lions (4-6) pulled off an impressive 103-101 overtime victory over Barcelona’s Anadolu Efes (8-2) at the Fernando Buesa Arena on Thursday. The biggest shocker of the game, however, was Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid’s (9-1) 71-64 home defeat to Unicaja Malaga (3-7).</p>
<p>The outcome of Thursday’s games left Gran Canaria and Unicaja tied for 7th place in the standings, while Real Madrid remained in first place. Anadolu Efes dropped to second place, followed by FC Barcelona Lassa (5-5), Maccabi FOX Tel Aviv (5-5), Darüşşafaka Doğuş Istanbul (4-6), Olympiacos Piraeus (4-6), and Telenor Baskonia Vitoria Gasteiz (3-7).</p>
<p>Gran Canaria got off to a quick start, scoring the first 6 points of the game. Efes battled back and took a 26-25 lead into halftime. The third quarter was close with both teams scoring 18 points. In the fourth quarter, Gran Canaria went on a 9-0 run to take a 83-76 lead with 2:37 left to play. Efes came back to tie it up at 89-89 with 19 seconds left on a 3 pointer by Krunoslav Simon. After both teams failed to score in regulation, Lionel Hollins’ team outlasted Efes 103-101 in overtime.</p>
<p>Starters Gian Clavell and Renaldas Seibutis led Gran Canaria with 22 points each. For Anadolu Efes, Bogdan Bogdanovic led all scorers with 31 points, but none of his teammates reached double figures.</p>
<p>In Thursday’s other game, Unicaja Malaga won its third game of the season over Spanish powerhouse Real Madrid 71-64 at the Wizink Center. It was only the second home loss for Real Madrid this season. With the win, Unicaja moved out of last place and into a tie for 7th place with Gran Canaria.</p>
<p>Unicaja got off to a fast start, taking an 18-8 lead after one quarter and extending it to 37-22 at halftime. Real Madrid came back to cut the lead to 4 points midway through the fourth quarter, but Unicaja held on for the win. Starter Nemanja Nedovic led all scorers with 20 points for Unicaja Malaga. Luka Doncic led Real Madrid with 16 points.</p>
<h1 id="Milovanovic-Leads-Efes-Over-Olympiacos-Under-Bounces-Back-For-Huge-Victory"><a href="#Milovanovic-Leads-Efes-Over-Olympiacos-Under-Bounces-Back-For-Huge-Victory" class="headerlink" title="Milovanovic Leads Efes Over Olympiacos; Under Bounces Back For Huge Victory"></a>Milovanovic Leads Efes Over Olympiacos; Under Bounces Back For Huge Victory</h1><p>In a matchup of teams near the top of the standings, Ekpe Udoh’s huge night led Efes Istanbul over Olympiacos Piraeus 91-83. Milovanovic paced the winners with 18 points on 4-of-7 shooting from downtown. Udoh was all over the place defensively and on the glass, finishing with 14 points, 11 rebounds, and five blocked shots. For Olympiacos, Vassilis Spanoulis led the way with 20 points while Kostas Papanikolaou had 16.</p>
<p>The first quarter was tightly contested with Olympiacos taking a one-point lead into the second. However, Efes would start to pull away in the second thanks to strong play from Udoh and Milovanovic. The duo combined for 29 points on 11-of-17 shooting as Efes took a 57-46 halftime lead.</p>
<p>Olympiacos came out charging in the third, getting within four at one point. However, once again Udoh and Milovanovic stepped up for Efes, scoring 10 of the team’s 17 points in the period as they took control of the game again. With Udoh anchoring things defensively, Efes held on for the 91-83 victory.</p>
