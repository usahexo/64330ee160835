#  Efes Beats Laboral Kutxa In Thriller After Under Comes Up BIG!

In a game that had everything, the Efes Pilsen beat FC Laboral Kutxa 94-92 Wednesday night in dramatic fashion. The game was back and forth the whole way, with neither team leading by more than six points. With Laboral Kutxa up 92-90 and only seconds remaining on the clock, Efes Pilsen’s Milan Macvan hit a three pointer to give his team the lead for good.

The game was not without controversy, as Laboral Kutxa appeared to have control of the ball with less than ten seconds remaining. However, after review it was ruled that the ball went out of bounds off of an Efes player, giving Macvan his chance to win the game.

For Macvan, it was a sweet victory after scoring only two points in the first half. “I think this is my best moment in basketball. I didn’t score in the first half but I kept fighting and when Coach called my number I just tried to do my best.” said Macvan after the game.

Both teams fought hard throughout, with Laboral Kutxa’s Jaka Lakovic (26 points) and Efes Pilsen’s Rudy Fernandez (25 points) leading their respective teams in scoring. Fernandez also had eight rebounds and four assists while Lakovic had six rebounds and six assists.

Efes Pilsen now advances to the Euroleague Final Four for the second consecutive year while FC Laboral Kutxa will have to content themselves with Champions League play next season.

#  Efes Falls Just Short To Valencia, But The Under Still Picks Up A Win!

It was a back and forth match all game long between Efes and Valencia, but the Turkish side just couldn’t overcome the Spanish squad in the end. However, despite the loss on the scoreboard, the Istanbul team was still able to get the win on the board, as they covered the spread with a final score of 94-89.

Efes got off to a quick start in this one, thanks in part to some hot shooting from guard Derrick Williams. The former 2nd overall pick in the NBA draft knocked down a trio of triples in the first quarter alone, as he helped his team take an early lead. That advantage would dissipate as the game went on, but Williams remained a force throughout, finishing with 24 points on 8-of-13 shooting from behind the arc.

While Williams was busy lighting it up from outside, Valencia players like Alberto Abalde and Sam Van Rossom were doing most of the damage inside. The two combined for 44 points on 19-of-32 shooting, as they led their team to a narrow victory. Abalde was particularly impressive down the stretch, scoring 11 of his 22 points in the fourth quarter alone.

Despite falling just short in the end, Efes can hold their heads high after covering the spread against one of Europe’s top teams. This young squad is definitely one to watch in future competitions!

# Efes Defeats FC Barcelona Behind Huge Night From Under!

#  Milovanovic Leads Efes Over Olympiacos; Under Bounces Back For Huge Victory

In a matchup of teams near the top of the standings, Ekpe Udoh's huge night led Efes Istanbul over Olympiacos Piraeus 91-83. Milovanovic paced the winners with 18 points on 4-of-7 shooting from downtown. Udoh was all over the place defensively and on the glass, finishing with 14 points, 11 rebounds, and five blocked shots. For Olympiacos, Vassilis Spanoulis led the way with 20 points while Kostas Papanikolaou had 16.

The first quarter was tightly contested with Olympiacos taking a one-point lead into the second. However, Efes would start to pull away in the second thanks to strong play from Udoh and Milovanovic. The duo combined for 29 points on 11-of-17 shooting as Efes took a 57-46 halftime lead.
