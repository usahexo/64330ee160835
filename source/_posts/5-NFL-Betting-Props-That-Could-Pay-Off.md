#  5 NFL Betting Props That Could Pay Off

As the NFL season rapidly approaches, there’s no time like the present to start paying attention to intriguing prop bets. This year, there are several that could result in a healthy payday.

Below are five NFL betting props that could pay off:

1. Odell Beckham Jr. to Record More Than 1,500 Receiving Yards

Odell Beckham Jr. is one of the most electrifying players in the NFL and is a lock to have another big season for the New York Giants. He’s currently being offered at +600 odds to break the 1,500-yard receiving mark. Considering that he’s surpassed that total in each of his first three seasons in the league, it would be foolish not to take this bet.

2. Le’Veon Bell Over/Under 1,200 Rushing Yards

Le’Veon Bell is coming off back-to-back seasons with over 1,200 rushing yards and should be able to eclipse that mark once again this year. The Pittsburgh Steelers will be depended on him heavily this season and he can easily reach the 1,200-yard plateau. The over/under betting line for Bell is set at 1,200 yards and it would be smart to take the over.

3. Julio Jones Over/Under 1,100 Receiving Yards

Another receiver who is sure to obliterate his over/under prop bet is Julio Jones of the Atlanta Falcons. He had an injury-plagued 2017 season but is still one of the best receivers in the league. He’s currently being offered at +280 odds to reach 1,100 yards or more this year and that’s a bet worth taking.

4. Tom Brady To Throw More Than 35 Touchdowns
For as long as Tom Brady continues playing football, he will continue putting up MVP-type numbers. This year should be no different as he has plenty of weapons at his disposal on offense. The New England Patriots quarterback is currently pegged at -180 odds to throw more than 35 touchdowns this season and those odds are well worth taking advantage of.

5. Andrew Luck Under/Over 4,000 Passing Yards







  It was great to see Andrew Luck back out on the field last week and looking like his old self again. However, there are some who believe that he may have rushed back too soon from his shoulder injury . As a result, it might be wise to stay away from betting on him surpassing 4,000 passing yards this year . The under/over prop for Luck is set at 4,000 yards and at current odds , it would be best to go with under .

#  Early Odds Suggest Minus Money On Broncos, Chiefs

NFL betting odds for the first week of the season are out, and according to reports, there is money being put down on the Broncos and Chiefs to lose their matchups.

The Chiefs are facing the Chargers in Los Angeles, and quarterback Patrick Mahomes will be making his first career start. The Chargers are 3-point favorites in that game, but early bets have come in at 85 percent on the Chargers and only 15 percent on the Chiefs.

The Broncos are also underdogs in their game against the Seahawks. Denver is a 4-point underdog, but early money has come in at 87 percent on the Seahawks and 13 percent on the Broncos.




#  Packers Favored, But Steelers Could Be Steal 

The Green Bay Packers opened as 5.5-point favorites over the Pittsburgh Steelers in Sunday’s NFC Championship Game, but the line has since shifted to the Steelers as 1-point favorites.

Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is playing some of the best football of his career, but the Steelers have a lot of firepower on offense, led by Ben Roethlisberger.

Green Bay’s defense has been struggling recently, while the Steelers’ defense has been playing well.

The Packers should be able to win this game, but the Steelers could be a steal at +1.

#  Expert Picks: Vegas Says Bengals Will Cover 

The professional handicappers at VegasInsider.com have released their Week 3 NFL picks, and they are unanimous in their selection of the Cincinnati Bengals to cover the spread against the Green Bay Packers. 

According to VegasInsider.com, the Bengals are currently four-point favorites over the Packers, with a point spread of -4. The over/under for the game is set at 48 points. 

In order to understand why Vegas is betting on the Bengals, it’s important to take a look at both teams’ recent performances. The Packers got off to a hot start this season, winning their first two games by a combined score of 68-24. However, they came up short in their last game against the Atlanta Falcons, losing 34-23. Meanwhile, the Bengals have struggled early on this season, losing their first two games by a combined score of 43-20. 

Despite their struggles so far this season, the Bengals are still a very talented team that is capable of beating anyone. They have one of the best quarterbacks in the league in Andy Dalton, as well as a stout defense that is led by defensive lineman Geno Atkins. The Packers will have a tough time stopping them on Sunday. 

The Packers are also dealing with some injuries heading into this game. Their top receiver Jordy Nelson is out for the season with a torn ACL, and their starting quarterback Aaron Rodgers is questionable with a hamstring injury. Without Nelson and Rodgers, the Packers may be forced to rely more on rookie running back Ty Montgomery, which could make things difficult against Cincinnati’s tough defense. 

Given these factors, it’s not surprising that Vegas is betting on the Bengals to cover in this game. I would recommend doing the same – take Cincinnati as your pick and enjoy watching them win on Sunday.

#  Pats minus-8.5 still biggest favorite on board

The New England Patriots remain the biggest favorite of the NFL Week 5 slate, with minus-8.5 points against the Indianapolis Colts.

After watching the Pittsburgh Steelers fall to the Jacksonville Jaguars last weekend, bettors have steered clear of teams laying more than a touchdown this week. Eighteen of the 20 games on the board have a spread of six points or less.

Of those, seven fall within a field goal, including three games with a pick 'em - Bengals at Browns, Raiders at Chargers and Giants at Panthers.

Here is a look at the complete list of spreads for Week 5:
