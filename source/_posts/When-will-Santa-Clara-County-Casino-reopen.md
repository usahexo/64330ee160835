#  When will Santa Clara County Casino reopen?

The Santa Clara County casino has been closed for renovation since March of this year. The renovation is said to include a new restaurant, expanded gaming area and a new bar. The cost of the renovation is estimated at $8 million. The expected reopening date was in September, but it has now been announced that the casino will not reopen until at least December.

There is no clear reason given for the delay in the reopening date, but some people are speculating that there may have been some problems with construction. There has been no official statement from the casino or its management regarding the reopening date or any possible problems with the renovation project.

The Santa Clara County casino is one of the busiest casinos in Northern California, so there is much interest in seeing what changes have been made and when it will reopen. It remains to be seen whether there will be further delays in the reopening or if everything is on track for a December opening.

#  Will the casino be open on Thanksgiving?

It’s that time of year again where people are debating whether or not the casino will be open on Thanksgiving. The answer, unfortunately, is no.

Thanksgiving is one of the busiest times of the year for casinos because many people want to use their holiday break to enjoy some gambling. However, casino staff also need time to spend with their families on Thanksgiving, so the casinos are usually closed.

There may be a few exceptions if a casino is in a touristy area where there is a lot of foot traffic. In that case, the casino may stay open to take advantage of the extra business. However, in most cases, casinos will be closed on Thanksgiving Day.

#  What is the dress code for the casino?
