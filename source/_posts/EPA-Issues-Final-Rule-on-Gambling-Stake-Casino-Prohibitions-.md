#  EPA Issues Final Rule on Gambling Stake Casino Prohibitions 

Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule prohibiting gambling stake casino activities.

Gambling stake casinos are commercial and tribal gaming establishments where players may gamble using disposable items, called stakes, rather than cash. The EPA has determined that these casinos pose a significant environmental threat as they often lead to the disposal of large quantities of non-biodegradable waste.

"This rule is intended to protect our environment by preventing the proliferation of gambling stake casinos," said EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy. "There is simply no way to ensure that these establishments will operate in an environmentally responsible manner."

The rule prohibits any new gambling stake casinos from opening as well as the expansion of existing ones. Exceptions will be made for tribal gaming facilities located on reservation lands and for states that have already enacted laws permitting gambling stake casinos.

The EPA's decision has been met with mixed reactions. Some proponents argue that it will help protect the environment while others maintain that it will deprive people of their right to gamble.

#  EPA Announces New Regulations Regarding Gambling Stake Casino Ownership 

Today, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced new regulations that will restrict casino ownership to individuals who have a stake in the casino of no more than $1,000.

"We believe that these new regulations will help protect the environment and safeguard the interests of casino players," said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. "It is important that casino ownership be limited to those who have a vested interest in seeing the casino succeed."

The new regulations will go into effect on January 1, 2020.

#  EPA Clarifies Definition of Gambling Stake Casino 

In a recent statement, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) clarified its definition of gambling stake casino. The clarification came in response to a casino industry petition that seeks to exclude electronic gaming devices from the category.

The EPA currently defines a gambling stake casino as "a business which is principally devoted to the operation of one or more slot machines, video poker devices, or other similar devices and which derives at least 80% of its annual gross revenue from the operation of such devices." The industry petition asks for an exception for electronic gaming devices, which it says should not be considered gambling equipment.

The EPA has not yet issued a ruling on the petition. In its statement, the agency said that it is still reviewing the information and will issue a final determination in the future.

#  EPA Publishes Guidelines for Gambling Stake Casino Compliance 

On October 10, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published final guidelines for gambling stake casino compliance. The new guidelines establish best practices for mitigating environmental impacts associated with the development and operation of gambling stake casinos, including reducing air and water pollution, protecting wildlife, and conserving natural resources.

“Our goal is to ensure that gambling stake casinos are developed and operated in a way that protects human health and the environment,” said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “These guidelines provide casino operators with the information they need to make sound decisions that minimize environmental impacts and benefit the community.”

The guidelines were developed in consultation with state and tribal governments, the gambling stake casino industry, environmental groups, and other stakeholders. They reflect latest scientific understanding of environmental impacts from gambling stake casinos and updated environmental laws and regulations.

The guidelines include: 

-Reducing air pollution from gambling stakecasinos by using cleaner fuels and equipment; 
-Preventing wastewater discharge from entering waterways; 
-Minimizing waste generation through source reduction, recycling, and composting; 
-Protecting sensitive populations such as children, pregnant women, and people with respiratory problems; 
- Conserving energy and water; 
-Managing landscaping around gambling stakecasinos to minimize impacts on wildlife; 
-Mitigating noise emissions from gaming facilities.

#  EPA Releases Resource Guide for Gambling Stake Casinos

### The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a new resource guide for gambling stake casinos to help them reduce their environmental footprint and improve their sustainability.

The EPA’s “Resource Guide for Gambling Stake Casino Sustainability” provides advice on how these businesses can minimize their energy use, reduce waste, and conserve resources. The guide also offers tips on how casinos can strengthen their ties with the local community and promote responsible gambling.

“Gambling stake casinos are an important part of many communities, and it is important that they operate in a sustainable way,” said EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler. “This resource guide will help casinos adopt practices that will protect our environment and improve the quality of life in these areas.”

The gambling industry is a major source of revenue for many states and communities, and EPA understands the importance of implementing sustainable practices while ensuring the economic viability of these businesses.

The Agency has been working with stakeholders in the gambling industry to develop this resource guide, which includes case studies from both successful and unsuccessful sustainability initiatives undertaken by casinos across the country.
