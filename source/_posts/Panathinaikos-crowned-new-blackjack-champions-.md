#  Thrilling blackjack victory for Panathinaikos over Olympiakos 

On Thursday night, the Panathinaikos Athens basketball club recorded an important victory against city rivals Olympiakos, in a tense and thrilling game that went down to the wire. 

The home side got off to a strong start, holding a healthy double-digit lead by halftime. However, Olympiakos fought back in the second half, and narrowed the gap to just two points with minutes remaining on the clock. However, Panathinaikos held their nerve to close out the game and secure an important win. 

For Panathinaikos' head coach Xavi Pascual, this was an especially sweet victory given that he had been sacked by Olympiakos only a few months earlier. "This is a very special win for me," said Pascual after the game. "I am very happy for my players, who worked very hard to get this victory." 

The result moves Panathinaikos up to second place in the Greek Basketball League Standings, just one point behind leaders AEK Athens. They will be looking to build on this win as they continue their push for the championship title.

#  Blackjack stars shine as Panathinaikos splits with Olympiakos 

In the derby of the eternal enemies, the stars of blackjack shined. Nick Mitropoulos and Georgios Samaras led their respective teams to an important victory in a match that ended 2-2.

Mitropoulos, who is having a great season so far, opened the scoring in the 38th minute with a well-placed shot from outside the area. The second half saw Olympiakos take control of the game, but they were unable to score. It was only in the 73rd minute that they equalized through a header by Nikolaos Manolas.

Ten minutes later, Samaras scored what would be the winning goal for Panathinaikos. Olympiakos pushed hard for an equalizer in the last few minutes but could not find one. This result means that Panathinaikos are now sixth in the league table, just four points behind Olympiakos.

#  Blackjack showdown: Panathinaikos v Olympiakos

The long-standing rivalry between Panathinaikos and Olympiakos is one of the most intense in European football. The two teams have met dozens of times in various competitions, with neither side ever holding a clear advantage.

This weekend sees the latest installment of this classic derby, as Panathinaikos hosts Olympiakos at the Karaiskakis Stadium. The home side will be hoping to continue their good form in the league, where they currently sit in second place, while Olympiakos will be looking to get back to winning ways after a disappointing start to their campaign.

The first meeting between these two sides this season ended in a 1-1 draw, with both goals coming in the second half. Dimitris Mavropanos put Panathinaikos ahead early on, but Nikolaou equalised for Olympiakos shortly afterwards.

Since then, Panathinaikos have beaten Asteras Tripoli 4-0 and PAOK Salonika 3-1, while Olympiakos have only won one match in their last six games. This would suggest that the home side are favourites ahead of this weekend's clash, but it's never easy to predict how these derbies will play out.

Panathinaikos will be without injured winger Ognjen Vranjes, while striker Lucas Evangelista is a doubt with a muscle problem. Olympiakos midfielder Kostas Fortounis is suspended after picking up his fifth yellow card of the season last weekend.

With so much at stake, this derby is sure to be a thriller. Who will come out on top?
