If you're looking to rob the Diamond Casino in Rocksprings, PGSoft has you covered! This guide will teach you everything you need to know before undertaking this heist.

Planning is key when robbing any casino, and the Diamond Casino is no exception. Locate the security room and disable the cameras and guards inside. There are several ways to do this; one way is to use a gas canister to render them unconscious.

Once the security room is clear, make your way to the vault. The quickest way is through the basement, but be careful as there are cameras and guards down there as well. The vault itself is protected by a security door; however, there is a button located on the wall behind the vault that will open it up.

Once inside, take whatever money and diamonds you want and make your escape! Be sure to disable the security systems on your way out so that you aren't caught.
